## Introduction :
Hi everybody, 

We are Malek Ghozzi and Mohamed Amine Boufares, tow young software ingeneeres. :smile:

We were working on this project for quiet a while during our **RFID** cours at **isitcom**. 

It's a Web App for an **E-Library** :book:, in which there's a page for: 

* The **Client part** where they can see all the books availabele in the library and they can add the book to a favorite list or they can buy it. Also they can search a book :mag: by it's name or author and filter the book list depending on : the number of pages, the price...

* Also there's the **Admin part** :cop:, where and Admin can add a book by specifieng it's : name, author, price...
Also the Admin will have a sort of a dashbord where he can see all the book availebele in the library and **increment** or **decrement** the quantity of the book and he can remove the book from the catlaogue.

This Web App is still in devlopment using the **MERN** stack: :rocket:
