# E-Libray


## Introduction :
Hi everybody, 

We are Malek Ghozzi and Mohamed Amine Boufares, two young software engineers. :smile:

We were working on this project for quite a while during our **RFID** course at **ISITCOM**. 

It's a Web App for an **E-Library** :book: in which there's a page for: 

* The **Client part** where they can see all the books available in the library and they can add the book to a favorite list or they can buy it. Also, they can search a book :mag: by its name or author and filter the book list depending on: the number of pages, the price...

* Also there's the **Admin part** :cop: where and Admin can add a book by specifying its: name, author, price...
Also, the Admin will have a sort of a dashboard where he can see all the books available in the library and **increment** or **decrement** the quantity of the book and he can remove the book from the catalog.

This Web App is still in devlopment using the **MERN** stack: :rocket:
